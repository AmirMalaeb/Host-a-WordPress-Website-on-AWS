Host a WordPress Website on AWS
WordPress on AWS: High-Availability Architecture
This project demonstrates the deployment of a high-availability WordPress website on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Utilizing a robust AWS infrastructure, the architecture ensures reliability, security, scalability, and fault tolerance. Below is an overview of the components and their configuration.
Architecture Overview
	•	Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Configured with public and private subnets across two availability zones to enhance system reliability and fault tolerance.
	•	Internet Gateway (IGW): Deployed to enable communication between VPC instances and the internet.
	•	Security Groups: Act as a network firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and other resources.
	•	Public Subnets: Used for the NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer, allowing public internet access to necessary resources.
	•	Private Subnets: Host the EC2 instances serving the WordPress site, enhancing security by restricting direct public access.
	•	EC2 Instances: Host the WordPress application, configured within an Auto Scaling Group for scalability and fault tolerance.
	•	Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2 instances in different availability zones.
	•	Auto Scaling Group: Manages the EC2 instances, ensuring optimal performance and availability.
	•	EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint: Provides secure SSH connectivity to EC2 instances within both public and private subnets.
	•	Amazon RDS: Hosts the WordPress database, offering managed database services with high availability and security.
	•	Amazon EFS: Used for a shared file system, allowing multiple EC2 instances to access the web files.
	•	AWS Certificate Manager: Secures application communications via SSL/TLS certificates.
	•	Amazon SNS: Configured to send notifications about activities within the Auto Scaling Group.
	•	Amazon Route 53: Manages the domain name and DNS settings, directing traffic to the ALB.
	•	NAT Gateway: Enables instances in private subnets to access the internet while keeping them secure from inbound traffic.

Deployment Steps
		Prepare your AWS environment: Configure the VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway, and Route 53 settings according to the architecture described above.
		Secure your application: Set up Security Groups, SSL/TLS certificates via AWS Certificate Manager, and ensure EC2 instances are placed in private subnets.
		Deploy WordPress: Use the provided scripts to deploy WordPress on EC2 instances within the Auto Scaling Group.
		Configure Database and Storage: Set up Amazon RDS for the WordPress database and EFS for shared file storage across EC2 instances.
		Monitor and Scale: Utilize the Auto Scaling Group and Amazon SNS to manage instance scaling and receive notifications on performance metrics.
